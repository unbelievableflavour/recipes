<span>Preheat a waffle-cone maker according to the manufacturer's instructions. Start with heat setting #3 and adjust as necessary, depending on the desired degree of brownness.</span>

* * *

<span>In a small bowl, sift together the</span> <span class="c16">flour</span><span>and</span> <span class="c22">cocoa powder</span><span class="c4">. Set aside.</span>

<span class="c4"></span>

<span>In a bowl, whisk together the</span> <span class="c8">eggs</span><span>and</span> <span class="c7">sugar</span><span>until the</span> <span class="c7">sugar</span><span>is incorporated and the</span> <span class="c8">eggs</span><span>have lightened in color, about 1 minute. Add the</span> <span class="c16">flour</span><span>mixture and stir until incorporated. Add the</span> <span class="c5">butter</span><span>, vanilla</span><span>and</span> <span class="c15">milk</span><span class="c4"> and stir until combined.</span>

<span class="c4"></span>

<span class="c4">Spoon a scant 1/4 cup batter onto the waffle-cone maker. Using a small offset spatula, spread the batter evenly over the surface. Close the lid and cook for at least 1 minute before lifting the lid to check for doneness. Continue cooking until the desired color is reached, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes total on heat setting #4.</span>

* * *

<span class="c4"></span>

<span class="c4">Quickly remove the waffle from the waffle-cone maker and shape it around the cone roller (included with the waffle-cone maker). Hold the cone for a few seconds to set its shape. Set the cone on a parchment-lined baking sheet.</span>

<span class="c4">Repeat with the remaining batter. Makes about 10 cones.</span>
